(Firstyears project #3)

For our third firstyears project we were told to create the software of a bank and matching ATM. The first part consisted of creating the software, including setting up the server side. The second part was creating the communication software with the other banks in our year, and creating a physical money dispenser.
This particular project was actually very interesting since it was much larger scale than the previous two projects, but also since it was the first time that we had multiple people working concurrently on the same code (hence the necessary git usage).

Part 1 included:
- first time really using an IDE (in our case, IntelliJ)
- setting up a server, using a virtual Ubuntu Linux, with a database
- programming our application and GUI, including the usage of the following:
    - Java (for application) / Java Swing (for GUI)
    - MySQL (for communication with the database), 
    - API's, 
    - JSON
- using Scrum to correctly distribute the tasks between the teammembers
- designing flowcharts (mainly for correct communication of the API's and the database, but also for the GUI)
- designing our database
- evaluating the security of our system
- start of coding the different components for the money dispenser (keypad, RFID scanner, receipt printer)

Part 2 included:
- correcting the mistakes observed by the product owner during the assessment of part 1
- designing the hardware, including the following components:
  - Lego Technic in combination with Arduino for the money dispensers
  - a numeral keypad for the pincode
  - a RFID scanner for scanning the bankcards
  - a DYMO printer for the receipts (without using the DYMO software)
- creating a communication protocol with the other banks and implementing this (must say this was a real pain in the butt since not everyone implented it correctly...)
